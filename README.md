# DigiCAT
Digital Counterfactual Analysis Tool

## Unit 01: Introduction to Counterfactual Analysis
### Overview

Congratulations! This is your first step towards your counterfactual analysis. Counterfactual analysis is an umbrella term for lots of different methods and approaches that can be performed on your data, and you can find an introduction to these within the units below. 

Our app, DigiCAT, is in developemnt using Shiny software with source code available, and will provide a point-and-click interface through which this complex procedure is made much easier!

You have several choices to make when progressing through the counterfactual analysis workflow, such as 'what variables should I match on?", "what effects do I wish to estimate?", "what model is best for me given my data?", and our walkthrough tutorials will hope to guide you through this, and can be further informed by your feedback. We are currently working on sharing open code in R, and plan to extend this to Python, too! Regardless of the programming language you use, the steps will in principle be the same.

### Key topics

The following topics will be covered:

### Unit 02: Propensity Calculation
  - Glm
  - Random forest
  - Gbm
### Unit 03: Matching
  - 1:1
  - CEM
  - NBP
### Unit 04: Weighting
  - IPTW
### Unit 05: Outcome analyses and treatment/exposure effects
### Unit 06: Counterfactual analysis: considerations
  - Ordinal vs. binary outcomes
  - Missingness handling
  - Calibration
  
 ## Using DigiCAT: Walkthrough
 
 
 
 ## Comprehension check: Tutorials/Homeworks
 
 You will be ready to go once you can answer:
 1. What effect do I want to estimate?
 2. What variables do I wish to include in different modelling stages?
 3. What is the output informing us about the exposure/treatment effects?

We are working on providing practice datasets which you will be able to explore and use to support your understanding.
